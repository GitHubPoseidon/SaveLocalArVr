# Unified 3D Scene Project Archive: Comprehensive Local Saving Mechanism

The provided schema defines a comprehensive local project saving mechanism for 3D scenes, enabling users to capture and archive an entire project's configuration, including 3D models, assets, textures, materials, sensor configurations, MQTT connections, node graphs, and interaction settings into a structured, self-contained package. By creating a standardized file hierarchy and JSON-based configuration, the system ensures that all project components can be faithfully restored, shared, and version-controlled across different environments, with built-in support for complex relationships between assets, metadata preservation, and seamless reconstruction of the original scene's intricate technical ecosystem.
